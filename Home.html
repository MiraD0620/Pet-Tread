        <h2>Our Mission...</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Here at Pet-Tread we want to create the experience of a walk in the park for a dog who may not live near a park or is cooped up in a city.
            Our goal is to really create the experience of the sounds,feel,and smell of a park for a dog who may not often get that. We want to benefit
            all dogs and owners through Pet-Tread. Your dog's well being is our first priority along with your time. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Goals...</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Create a better exercise experience for your pet.</li>
        <li>Let dogs that may not have the chance to get daily walks get enough exercise.</li>
        <li>Allow dogs who mostly walk on the pavement or in a city get the experience almost like walking in the park</li>
        <li>Save your time.</li>
    </ul>

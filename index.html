        </div>
        <p>Here at Pet-Tread we want to create the expirence of a walk in the park for a dog who may not live near a park or is cooped up in a city.
            Our goal is to really create the expirence of the sounds,feel,and smell of a park for a dog who may not often get that. We want to benifit
            all dogs and owners through Pet-Tread. Your dog's well being is our first proirity along with your time. 
        </p>
        <h4>Our Goals.....</h4> 
    <ol>
        <li>Create a better excerise expirence for your pet.</li>
        <li>Let dogs that may not have the chance to get daily walks get enough exersise.</li>
        <li>Allow dogs who mostly walk on the pavment or in a city get the expirence almost like walking in the park</li>
        <li>Save your time.</li>
    </ol>

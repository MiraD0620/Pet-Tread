        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our team consists of 5 founders who all came together to create Pet-Tread. 
            Each person contributes a special aspect to our team. We came together in 2019 and 
            had the idea for Pet-Tread after reading a book about a city dog stuck inside. When Covid hit, we realized that 
            many dog owners did not want to go outside even to walk their dog! We decided to create the 
            Pet-Tread which started as a normal dog treadmill and from there, we made it into a whole immersive
            experience for the dog so that it felt like a walk in the park.
